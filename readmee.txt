Division of Labour :
we started brainstorming on what are the main ideas of the project ,the design patterns to be used and how we will present it.
we took  time to make sure that each member got a sense about direction, and goals that have to be followed and achieved.
we Splitted the project into tasks and we set a deadline for each given task so we can all be sure the job will be done on time.
the first four tasks was :
 making the fruits move up and down by using Factory design pattern to generate objects.
 making the mouse move and perform an action.
 implementing the function of slicicng fruits.
 Applying singleton design pattern.
the second four tasks :
 Applying the design pattern for levels of difficulty (State Design pattern).
 Appling momento design pattern to record player score.
 Applying MVC.
 Applying iterator design pattern to loop over arraylists of gameobjects.
then we collected what we have done in the last version of the project.
we started thinking in bonus and we decided to make music as a background to our game.
